## Notebooks Overview

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for each week of the Advanced Track:

- `week1_eda.ipynb` - Exploratory Data Analysis
- `week2_feature_engineering.ipynb` - Feature Engineering & Deep Learning Prep
- `week3_neural_network.ipynb` - Neural Network Design & Baseline Training
- `week4_model_tuning.ipynb` - Model Tuning & Explainability
- `week5_deployment.ipynb` - Model Deployment

## Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment
2. Start Jupyter: `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`
3. Open the notebook for the current week
4. Follow the instructions and complete the tasks

## Dependencies

All required dependencies are specified in the project's `pyproject.toml` file.
