# Project Scope of Works:

## Project Overview
**GlucoTrack** is a machine learning and deep learning project focused on predicting a personâ€™s risk level of diabetesâ€”**healthy**, **pre-diabetic**, or **diabetic**â€”based on their lifestyle, health history, and demographic data.

Using a real-world dataset funded by the **CDC**, this project empowers participants to identify early warning signs and patterns in diabetes onset using a wide range of personal health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol checks, physical activity, BMI, diet, and healthcare access.

Participants will take on either:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner Track** â€“ Build a classification model using traditional ML techniques to predict diabetes status from health indicators

- ðŸ”´ **Advanced Track** â€“ Design a deep learning classifier (FFNN) that learns complex interactions between features, with explainability via SHAP or similar tools

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Track

### Week 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Check for missing values (even though none are expected)
- Identify and correct inconsistent entries or formatting issues
- Confirm appropriate data types for each column (e.g., integers, categories)
- Remove any duplicate rows (if present)

#### 2. Data Formatting & Encoding
- Convert binary categorical features into 0/1 if needed
- Label encode ordinal categorical features (e.g., education, income levels)
- One-hot encode nominal categorical features (if applicable)

#### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Explore the distribution of numerical features (e.g., BMI, age group, mental/physical health days)
- Identify skewed features and consider transformation if necessary
- Analyze class distribution of the target variable (`Diabetes_binary`)
- Check for data imbalance and decide on strategies for handling it (e.g., SMOTE, class weights)

#### 4. Correlation & Interaction Analysis
- Create a correlation heatmap for numerical features
- Explore pairwise relationships between features using scatter plots or violin plots

- Consider interaction terms between highly correlated features (e.g., HighBP Ã— BMI, Age Ã— PhysActivity)
- Group age levels into broader age brackets if needed (e.g., young, middle-aged, senior)

### 2. Handling Categorical Variables
- Ensure all binary and ordinal variables are encoded properly
- For any remaining nominal variables, apply one-hot encoding if necessary

### 3. Scaling & Normalization
- Apply feature scaling to continuous variables like BMI, MentHlth, PhysHlth (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler)
- Avoid scaling categorical or encoded binary variables

### 4. Data Splitting
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling
- Ensure class distribution is consistent across splits
