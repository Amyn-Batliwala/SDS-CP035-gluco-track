## 🟢 Beginner Track

The **Beginner Track** is perfect for those looking to build a solid foundation in machine learning. You will work on cleaning and exploring the CDC diabetes dataset, build traditional ML models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, and deploy your final model using Streamlit.

📌 Get started:
➡️ [Beginner Track Scope of Works](./beginner/README.md)
➡️ [Beginner Report Template](./beginner/REPORT.md)
➡️ [Submit your work](./beginner/submissions/)

---

## 🔴 Advanced Track

The **Advanced Track** is for participants who are ready to apply deep learning techniques and explore explainability tools. You’ll design and train a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), experiment with hyperparameter tuning, and optionally deploy your model via APIs or Dockerized Streamlit apps.

📌 Get started:
➡️ [Advanced Track Scope of Works](./advanced/README.md)
➡️ [Advanced Report Template](./advanced/REPORT.md)
➡️ [Submit your work](./advanced/submissions/)
